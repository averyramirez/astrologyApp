## Oscillations

"Oscillations" is an astrology web app I created that uses an API to provide the user with a daily horoscope reading. Background randomly populates after refresh.

- Hosted as a [page](https://averyramirez.github.io/astrologyApp/) on GitHub
- Created using Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery
- Uses [Aztro - The Astrology API](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro/) for horoscopes
- Companion app [Planetary Positions](https://averyramirez.github.io/planetaryPositions/) in progress
