## Oscillations

"Oscillations" is an astrology web app I created with the help of a few different API's. The user is provided a daily horoscope, as well as the current transits for both the Moon and Mercury retrograde. Background randomly populates after refresh.

- Hosted as a [page](https://averyramirez.github.io/astrologyApp/) on GitHub
- Created using Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery
- Uses [Aztro - The Astrology API](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro/) for horoscopes
- Uses [FarmSense](https://www.farmsense.net/api/astro-widgets/) for moon phases
- Uses [Mercury Retrograde API](https://mercuryretrogradeapi.com/about.html) for Mercury retrograde information
